# Handwriting Number Recognition based on SVM 

# Support Vector Machine(SVM)

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. 

In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples.

Our goal is to find the line passing as far as possible from all points of each separable set.

The operation of the SVM algorithm is based on finding the hyperplane that gives the largest minimum distance to the training examples.

The optimal separating hyperplane maximizes the margin of the training data.
